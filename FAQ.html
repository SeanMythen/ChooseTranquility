            <div class="faq-title">What is Vibrational Sound Therapy?</div>
            Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) is a method of professionally using therapeutic
            grade singing bowls and other instruments on and around the body for therapy and relaxation.

        <div class="faq-container">
            <div class="faq-title">How Does Vibrational Sound Therapy Work?</div>
            Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) combines powerful vibration and tones to induce an immediate relaxed state.
            The induction of the sound waves directly into the body, along with soothing ambient tones, is such a
            strong treatment that clients report effects ranging from a meditative state to deep relaxation. By placing
            the therapeutic singing bowls directly on the body, and using correct techniques, a practitioner engages
            with their client both physically, and aurally. Also known as vibrational sound massage.

            <div class="faq-title">What makes the bowls therapeutic grade?</div>
            Therapeutic grade singing bowls may have a similar look to traditional hand hammered bowls, but that is
            where the similarities end. The bowls used in VST are specifically engineered to provide vibration over
            sound. The sizes and vibrational characteristics are matched to the various body zones where they are used.
            The therapeutic series bowls that I work with are designed for use in hospitals and are the safest singing
            bowls on the market today. The bowls are a perfect bell metal mixture, free of impurities and potentially
            toxic metals found in traditional cottage industry bowls or antique bowls due to lack of regulation.

            <div class="faq-title">What happens during a VST session?</div>
            Vibrational Sound therapy has profound effects on the body and the mind. The session is, above all, a
            method of relaxation. Most people will reach this state of relaxation quickly, even during their first
            session. During a VST session the body will go through noticeable changes as it responds to deeper and
            deeper states of rest. Relaxation occurs on the physical level, as well as on the state of consciousness.
            Sessions generally have very strong effects on alertness and perception. Relaxation during a session brings
            on the same kind of brain states as yoga, tai chi, and meditation.
