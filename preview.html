            <h4>Welcome to your relaxed self!</h4>
        <p>If you've found yourself on this page you are already on the first step toward choosing tranquility.
            Tranquility is a state of peace or calm and I can help you get there through relaxation. Relaxation is a
            state of existence liberated from tension and stress.</p>
        <p>Tension and stress are two natural forces that affect the body and our overall health. Stress is a part of
            everyday life. It is a balancing tool that can help us to react quickly to sudden situations. We already
            know that repeated stress has negative effects on our health. Many things can trigger stress, it varies
            from individual to individual, and each person has a different built-in response to stress.</p>
        <p>To decrease the effects of stress on the body and mind, one of the relaxation techniques I use is
            vibrational sound which induces relaxation. Contact me to continue your journey of tranquility.</p>

                <p>I’m a Registered Yoga Teacher and a Certified Practitioner of Vibrational Sound Therapy.</p>
                <p>Vibrational Sound Therapy is a method of deep relaxation that can relieve stress and improve emotional
                    well-being. It combines vibration and sound to induce an immediate relaxed state. A session is similar
                    to a
                    massage, but you remain fully clothed and the only areas of contact are bowls being placed on the body.</p>
                <p>I use the Measured Strike Technique to create waves that penetrate deeply into tissues and provide you
                    with
                    a greater sense of relaxation. This technique produces a long lasting sound, with an even volume and
                    consistent vibration throughout the session. It is not vigorous, but the waves are powerful and the
                    process
                    is effective.</p>
                <p>The system of relaxation I use is designed to elicit the relaxation response through multiple channels,
                    increasing its effectiveness, and shortening the overall time between the base stress level and the
                    relaxation response point. The unique thing about this relaxation technique is that once the client
                    becomes
                    familiar with the process, the relaxed state can become more pronounced and induced more quickly.</p>

                <div class="faq-title">What is Vibrational Sound Therapy?</div>
                Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) is a method of professionally using therapeutic
                grade singing bowls and other instruments on and around the body for therapy and relaxation.
            </div>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-title">How Does Vibrational Sound Therapy Work?</div>
                Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) combines powerful vibration and tones to induce an immediate relaxed state.
                The induction of the sound waves directly into the body, along with soothing ambient tones, is such a
                strong treatment that clients report effects ranging from a meditative state to deep relaxation. By placing
                the therapeutic singing bowls directly on the body, and using correct techniques, a practitioner engages
                with their client both physically, and aurally. Also known as vibrational sound massage.

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-title">What makes the bowls therapeutic grade?</div>
                Therapeutic grade singing bowls may have a similar look to traditional hand hammered bowls, but that is
                where the similarities end. The bowls used in VST are specifically engineered to provide vibration over
                sound. The sizes and vibrational characteristics are matched to the various body zones where they are used.
                The therapeutic series bowls that I work with are designed for use in hospitals and are the safest singing
                bowls on the market today. The bowls are a perfect bell metal mixture, free of impurities and potentially
                toxic metals found in traditional cottage industry bowls or antique bowls due to lack of regulation.

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-title">What happens during a VST session?</div>
                Vibrational Sound therapy has profound effects on the body and the mind. The session is, above all, a
                method of relaxation. Most people will reach this state of relaxation quickly, even during their first
                session. During a VST session the body will go through noticeable changes as it responds to deeper and
                deeper states of rest. Relaxation occurs on the physical level, as well as on the state of consciousness.
                Sessions generally have very strong effects on alertness and perception. Relaxation during a session brings
                on the same kind of brain states as yoga, tai chi, and meditation.
