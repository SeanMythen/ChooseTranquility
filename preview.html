            <p id="homeText">My name is Sonia. If you've found yourself on this page you are already on the first step
                toward
                choosing tranquility.
                Tranquility is a state of peace or calm and I can help you get there through relaxation. Relaxation is
                a
                state of existence liberated from tension and stress.
                <br><br>
                Tension and stress are two natural forces that affect the body and our overall health. Stress is a part
                of
                everyday life. It is a balancing tool that can help us to react quickly to sudden situations. We
                already
                know that repeated stress has negative effects on our health. Many things can trigger stress, it varies
                from individual to individual, and each person has a different built-in response to stress.
                <br><br>
                To decrease the effects of stress on the body and mind, one of the relaxation techniques I use is
                vibrational sound which induces relaxation. Contact me to continue your journey of tranquility.

                    Vibrational Sound Therapy is a method of deep relaxation that can relieve stress and improve emotional
                    well-being. It combines vibration and sound to induce an immediate relaxed state. A session is similar
                    to a
                    massage, but you remain fully clothed and the only areas of contact are bowls being placed on the body.

                I had my first vibration sound therapy session at Choose Tranquility and was very impressed. I have an incredibly
                stressful new job and am very tense all the time. I also have a hard time falling asleep. During the vibration
                session, I actually fell asleep. I have had numerous massages and pampering facials and have NEVER fallen asleep
                during any of those treatments. The vibration session was truly relaxing. Not only did I fall asleep, but I felt
                incredibly calm and at east the rest of the day. Sonia is very professional, explains the technique to you
                beforehand ensuring you are completely comfortable with everything. I highly recommend Sonia and vibration sound
                therapy - it really works!

                <div class="faq-title">What is Vibrational Sound Therapy?</div>
                Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) is a method of professionally using therapeutic
                grade singing bowls and other instruments on and around the body for therapy and relaxation.
            </div>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-title">How Does Vibrational Sound Therapy Work?</div>
                Vibrational Sound Therapy (VST) combines powerful vibration and tones to induce an immediate relaxed state.
                The induction of the sound waves directly into the body, along with soothing ambient tones, is such a
                strong treatment that clients report effects ranging from a meditative state to deep relaxation. By placing
                the therapeutic singing bowls directly on the body, and using correct techniques, a practitioner engages
                with their client both physically, and aurally. Also known as vibrational sound massage.

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-title">What makes the bowls therapeutic grade?</div>
                Therapeutic grade singing bowls may have a similar look to traditional hand hammered bowls, but that is
                where the similarities end. The bowls used in VST are specifically engineered to provide vibration over
                sound. The sizes and vibrational characteristics are matched to the various body zones where they are used.
                The therapeutic series bowls that I work with are designed for use in hospitals and are the safest singing
                bowls on the market today. The bowls are a perfect bell metal mixture, free of impurities and potentially
                toxic metals found in traditional cottage industry bowls or antique bowls due to lack of regulation.

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-title">What happens during a VST session?</div>
                Vibrational Sound therapy has profound effects on the body and the mind. The session is, above all, a
                method of relaxation. Most people will reach this state of relaxation quickly, even during their first
                session. During a VST session the body will go through noticeable changes as it responds to deeper and
                deeper states of rest. Relaxation occurs on the physical level, as well as on the state of consciousness.
                Sessions generally have very strong effects on alertness and perception. Relaxation during a session brings
                on the same kind of brain states as yoga, tai chi, and meditation.
